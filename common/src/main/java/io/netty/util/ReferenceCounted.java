/**
 * A reference-counted object that requires explicit deallocation.
 * 一个引用计数的对象，需要显式释放。
 * <p>
 * When a new {@link ReferenceCounted} is instantiated, it starts with the reference count of {@code 1}.
 * {@link #retain()} increases the reference count, and {@link #release()} decreases the reference count.
 * If the reference count is decreased to {@code 0}, the object will be deallocated explicitly, and accessing
 * the deallocated object will usually result in an access violation.
 * 当实例化一个新的ReferenceCounted时，它以1的引用计数开始。keep（）增加引用计数，而release（）减少引用计数。
 * 如果引用计数减少到0，则将显式释放对象，并且访问该释放对象通常会导致访问冲突。
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If an object that implements {@link ReferenceCounted} is a container of other objects that implement
 * {@link ReferenceCounted}, the contained objects will also be released via {@link #release()} when the container's
 * reference count becomes 0.
 * 如果实现ReferenceCounted的对象是其他实现ReferenceCounted的对象的容器，则当容器的引用计数变为0时，包含的对象也将通过release（）释放。
